    "# 1. Scale invariance\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics, mathematics, statistics, and economics, scale invariance is a feature of objects or laws that do not change if scales of length, energy, or other variables, are multiplied by a common factor, thus represent a universality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In mathematics, scale invariance usually refers to an invariance of individual functions or curves. A closely related concept is self-similarity, where a function or curve is invariant under a discrete subset of the dilatations. The Kotch curve (below) is an example of fractal, that are self-similarity curves.\n",
    "- In statistical mechanics, scale invariance is a feature of phase transitions. The key observation is that near a phase transition or critical point, fluctuations occur at all length scales, and thus one should look for an explicitly scale-invariant theory to describe the phenomena.\n",

    "# 2. Sandpile model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Abelian sandpile model, also known as the Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld model, was the first discovered example of a dynamical system displaying self-organized criticality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is a cellular automaton. In its original formulation, each site on a finite grid has an associated value that corresponds to the slope of the pile. This slope builds up as \"grains of sand\" (or \"chips\") are randomly placed onto the pile, until the slope exceeds a specific threshold value at which time that site collapses transferring sand into the adjacent sites, increasing their slope. There is a successive random placement of sand grains on the grid; each such placement of sand at a particular site may have no effect, or it may cause a cascading reaction that will affect many sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original interest behind the model stemmed from the fact that in simulations on lattices, it is attracted to its critical state, at which point the correlation length of the system and the correlation time of the system go to infinity, without any fine tuning of a system parameter. This contrasts with earlier examples of critical phenomena, such as the phase transitions between solid and liquid, or liquid and gas, where the critical point can only be reached by precise tuning (e.g., of temperature). Hence, in the sandpile model we can say that the criticality is self-organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the sandpile model reaches its critical state there is no correlation between the system's response to a perturbation and the details of a perturbation. Generally this means that dropping another grain of sand onto the pile may cause nothing to happen, or it may cause the entire pile to collapse in a massive slide. The model also displays 1/ƒ noise, a feature common to many complex systems in nature.\n",

    "# 3. Bak-Sneppen model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bak–Sneppen model is a simple model of co-evolution between interacting species. It was developed to show how self-organized criticality may explain key features of the fossil record, such as the distribution of sizes of extinction events and the phenomenon of punctuated equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model dynamics repeatedly eliminates the least adapted species and mutates it and its neighbors to recreate the interaction between species. We consider N species, which are associated with a fitness factor f(i). They are indexed by integers i around a ring. The algorithm consists in choosing the least fit species, and then replacing it and its two closest neighbors (previous and next integer) by new species, with a new random fitness. After a long run there will be a minimum required fitness, below which species don't survive. These \"long-run\" events are referred to as avalanches, and the model proceeds through these avalanches until it reaches a state of relative stability where all species' fitness are above a certain threshold.\n",
