## Workshop 3: Collective Avalanches and Criticality

This workshop presents concepts about collective behaviour in self-organized systems, using simple models as sand-piles or evolutionary models.
The workshop is composed by two parts:
* [Self-organized Criticality](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IsaacLab/LaboratorioIntangible/blob/master/T3/T3.2-Self-Organized-Criticality.ipynb)
* [Minimal Social Interaction](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IsaacLab/LaboratorioIntangible/blob/master/T3/T3.3-Social-Minimal-Interaction.ipynb)
