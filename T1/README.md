## Workshop 1: Emergence and self-organization

This workshop introduces notions of coding and mathematical models to simulate properties living systems: emergence, self-organization, adaptation, self-maintenance, etc.

The workshop is composed by two parts:
* [Elementrary Cellular Automata](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IsaacLab/LaboratorioIntangible/blob/master/T1/T1.1-Cellular-automata.ipynb)
* [Game of Life](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IsaacLab/LaboratorioIntangible/blob/master/T1/T1.2-Game-of-life.ipynb)
