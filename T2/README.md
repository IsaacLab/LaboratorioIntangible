## Workshop 2: Self-Replication and Evolution

This workshop introduces some simple models of self-replicating systems, and introduces notions about evolution
The workshop is composed by two parts:
* [Self-replicating Automata](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IsaacLab/LaboratorioIntangible/blob/master/T2/T2.1-Self-replicating-automata.ipynb)
* [Evolutive Systems](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IsaacLab/LaboratorioIntangible/blob/master/T2/T2.2-Evolution.ipynb)
