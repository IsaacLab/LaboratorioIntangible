# LaboratorioIntangible

* [Workshop 1: Emergence and self-organization](https://github.com/IsaacLab/LaboratorioIntangible/blob/master/T1/README.md)
* [Workshop 2: Replication and evolution](https://github.com/IsaacLab/LaboratorioIntangible/blob/master/T2/README.md)
* [Workshop 3: Avalanches and criticality](https://github.com/IsaacLab/LaboratorioIntangible/blob/master/T3/README.md)
* [Workshop 4: Networks and collective phenomena](https://github.com/IsaacLab/LaboratorioIntangible/blob/master/T3/README.md)

The workshops assume some basic knowledge of programming, with examples in Processing and Python, although they are intended to be easy to follow for students with begginer coding skills. If you have never coded before, we recommend that you take a look first to [workshop 1: Introduction to Processing](https://github.com/IsaacLab/LaboratorioIntangible/blob/master/T0/README.md)
